Workshop notebook for a guest lecture on wrangling text data with Python. View the basics online [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/walshbr/wrangling-texts/blob/master/Wrangling%20Text%20Data%20in%20Python.ipynb). There is also a very quick and dirty implementation of word2vec [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/walshbr/wrangling-texts/blob/master/word2vec.ipynb) to  play with.
